Welcome to the development blog for my raytracer project! This blog will document the journey of building a physically-based ray tracer from scratch, exploring rendering techniques, and solving interesting problems along the way.

## Follow Along

I'll be posting regularly about new features, rendering techniques, and lessons learned. Stay tuned for more updates!
